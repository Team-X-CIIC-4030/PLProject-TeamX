### Project description: A python-like language design for students with socio-humanistic backgrounds. The language was implemented using PLY. PLY is a straightforward parsing tool written purely in Python. It includes support for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and ambiguous grammar

Features of PLY:
It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars.
PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for ambiguous grammars.
PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.
PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less than provide the basic lex/yacc functionality. In other words, it's not a large parsing framework or a component of some larger system.
